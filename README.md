# Real-Estate-Tableau-dashboard
A dynamically-updated dashboard to test the robustness of my model through sensitivity analysis.
I have created a dynamic dashboard for a real estate company who is looking to test profitablity if their customers lease out their properties on AirBnb instead of long term rentals.
The dashboard assesses profitability by testing 8 dynamic metrics being Average Length of Stay, Depreciation Years, Repair & replacement costs, Utilities Costs, Capital expenditure, Profitability threshold, transaction fees and variable cost per guest.
By changing the above metrics, the company can get a guage of how changing costs can impact their profitability.
